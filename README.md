# Translating Sign Language to Speech

This repository contains the source code and resources for a project that translates sign language motions into spoken English using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), OpenCV, and You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection framework. The goal of this project is to facilitate communication between sign language users and non-signers by providing real-time sign language gesture recognition and translation into spoken words.

## Project Overview
This project introduces a method to convert sign language gestures into spoken English by leveraging modern machine learning techniques. Millions of people globally rely on sign language for communication, and there is often a communication barrier between sign language users and non-signers. This system addresses that gap by recognizing sign language gestures in real-time and converting them into speech.

The system uses:
- **CNN** for extracting features from gesture images
- **OpenCV** for image preprocessing and manipulation
- **YOLO** for real-time object (gesture) detection

This allows for fast and accurate detection of hand signs, promoting better inclusion for those with hearing impairments in social and professional settings.

## Features
- **Real-time gesture recognition**: Recognizes sign language gestures on the fly.
- **Speech output**: Converts recognized gestures into spoken English.
- **Accurate and fast detection**: Utilizes CNN and YOLO for high-speed and precise gesture detection.
- **User-friendly interface**: Easy to use for both sign language users and non-signers.
  
## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: For gesture recognition.
- **OpenCV**: For image preprocessing and manipulation.
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**: Real-time object detection framework.
- **Deep Learning Libraries**: Keras/TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the implementation).

## Installation
To get started with this project, clone the repository and follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sign-language-to-speech.git
   cd sign-language-to-speech

2. **Install required dependencies**
   Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Then, install the required libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

  Common dependencies include:
- `numpy`
- `opencv-python`
- `tensorflow` or `pytorch`
- `yolov5` or `darknet` (YOLO version)
- `pillow`

3. **Download pre-trained model weights**
    Download the YOLO pre-trained weights and place them in the /models folder:
   -`YOLOv3 or YOLOv5 weights: YOLO official`


4. **Prepare the dataset**
    You will need a dataset of labeled sign language gestures. You can either use an existing 
     dataset or collect your own.
## Usage
1. **Run the system**
 After installation, use the following command to run the real-time gesture recognition system:
   ```bash
   python app.py
3. **System Interface**
 The system will open a window that captures gestures via webcam and displays the recognized sign language motions with corresponding spoken English output.

## Dataset
The system requires a labeled dataset of sign language gestures for training. You can use publicly available datasets such as the American Sign Language (ASL) Alphabet Dataset or collect your own dataset of gestures. Ensure that the images are labeled with the corresponding letters or words.

## System Architecture
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing:** The input is live video feed from a webcam. Frames are extracted and preprocessed using OpenCV.
2. **CNN Model:** A pre-trained CNN model is used to extract features from each frame, focusing on hand gestures.
3. **YOLO Detection:** YOLO is integrated for real-time gesture detection and classification, providing high-speed detection.
4. **Speech Conversion:** Once gestures are identified, they are mapped to corresponding spoken words or letters, which are then converted into speech output using a text-to-speech engine.

## Future Improvements
- **Gesture Dictionary Expansion**: Extend the system to recognize more complex signs and entire sentences.
- **Multi-language Support**: Add support for translating recognized gestures into multiple spoken languages.
- **User Customization**: Allow users to add their own custom gestures and corresponding speech outputs.
- **Mobile and Web Application**: Develop mobile and web versions of the system for wider accessibility.
